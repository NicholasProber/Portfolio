            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I have always been interested in Development. I was in a program while in Highschool 11 years ago and have always regretted not following through with it. I tried going to college for CS two different times, each time I had to make the decision to continue school or continue working to pay bills + save to eventually purchase a home. This decision slowed down my process to get into development but it definetely paid off for me. 
            <p>I now do Doordash + Instacart fulltime, these applications have so many issues that it has actually sparked interest in me to get back into development. I have a completely open schedule so I am ready to advance my skils and launch a new career!.</p>
